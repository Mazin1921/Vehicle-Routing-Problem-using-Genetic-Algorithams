# ðŸšš Vehicle Routing Problem Using Genetic Algorithm

## Introduction
This project aims to solve the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) using a Genetic Algorithm (GA). The VRP involves distributing items to `n` locations using `k` vehicles such that the total distance traveled is minimized, and the item distribution among vehicles is as balanced as possible.

## ðŸ¤”What is Genetic Algoritam (GA)?
A genetic algorithm is a type of optimization algorithm inspired by the process of natural selection. Itâ€™s used to solve complex problems by evolving solutions over generations.


## âœ¨ Features
- Efficiently distributes items to multiple locations
- Minimizes the total travel distance
- Balances item distribution among available vehicles
- Utilizes a Genetic Algorithm for optimization

## ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `pandas`
  - `scipy`

You can install the required libraries using the following command:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib pandas scipy
